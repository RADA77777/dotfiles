This file gives a blurred background to any application in your desktop

To add a new application, get the class of the window using 

$ xprop | grep "WM_CLASS(STRING)"

and then click on the window. Then, copy the name of the second attibute and paste it on the opacity.ds file (sometimes, windows
have 2 class names. You need to use the second one)

As you can see in the file, I only use this blurred effect for Discord and VSCode, but you can use it on any application


The 0.80 value is responsible for indicating how much opacity you want. I personaly use 80%, but this can be changed
to any other value
